;; Pandigital products
;; Problem 32

;; We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

;; The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

;; Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
;; HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
